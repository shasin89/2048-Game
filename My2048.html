      <p>This is my version of 2048.  The codes are written in processing IDE.</p>
        
        <h3>Rules to play the game:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>2048 played on a 4x4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys</li>

<li>For every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty tile with a value of either 2 or 4</li>

<li>Tiles slide in the chosen direction as far as possible and are stopped by either another tile or the edge of board</li>

<li>If two tiles of the same number collide, they will merge into a tile with the number multiplies by two</li>

<li>The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move</li>

<li>The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 appears</li>

<li>The game ends when there are no empty blocks and adjacent tiles with the same value</li>
</ol>
